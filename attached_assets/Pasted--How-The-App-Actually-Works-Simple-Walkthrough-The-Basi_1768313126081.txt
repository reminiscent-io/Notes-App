# How The App Actually Works (Simple Walkthrough)

## The Basic User Experience

### Opening the App
You open it on your phone. You see:
- A clean screen, mostly empty
- Maybe today's date at the top
- A **big microphone button** at the bottom (think like the Shazam button - impossible to miss)
- Above that, your recent notes/tasks in a simple list

### Capturing a Thought (The Core Action)

**You tap the mic button:**
1. Screen goes into "listening mode" - maybe the background slightly darkens, mic button pulses
2. You speak: *"Remind me to call Mom tomorrow at 3pm"*
3. You tap the mic again to stop (or it auto-stops after silence)
4. You see the text appear on screen: "Remind me to call Mom tomorrow at 3pm"
5. Behind the scenes:
   - Audio → OpenAI Whisper → text transcription
   - Text → GPT-4 → understands this is a reminder with a person (Mom), time (3pm tomorrow), and action (call)
   - Saves both the raw text AND the structured data

**You immediately see** a new card appear that says:
- 📞 **Call Mom** 
- Tomorrow, 3:00 PM

### That's it. The core loop is done.

## The Two Modes of the App

### Mode 1: CAPTURE (Voice Input)
- Big mic button always visible
- Quick, frictionless recording
- Instant feedback showing what you said
- Auto-saves everything

### Mode 2: REVIEW (Visual + Voice Query)
- **Visual Review**: Scroll through your notes organized by type/date
  - Today's tasks
  - Tomorrow's tasks  
  - Random notes and ideas
  - Shopping lists
  
- **Voice Query**: Instead of scrolling, tap mic and ask:
  - "What do I need to do today?"
  - "What did Christopher want again?"
  - "Show me all my app ideas"
  - AI searches your notes and tells you

## Best Way to Design It

### The Interface Should Be:

#### **1. Single Screen with Sections (No Complex Navigation)**

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Voice Notes           │ ← Simple header
├─────────────────────────┤
│                         │
│  🔍 [Ask me anything]   │ ← Voice query button (smaller)
│                         │
│  📋 TODAY               │
│  ☐ Call Mom - 3pm       │
│  ☐ Client analysis due  │
│                         │
│  💡 IDEAS               │
│  • Voice notes app...   │
│                         │
│  🛒 TO BUY              │
│  • Avocados             │
│                         │
│  ▼ Show more...         │
│                         │
├─────────────────────────┤
│       🎤  [RECORD]      │ ← BIG mic button (fixed)
└─────────────────────────┘
```

#### **2. Information Hierarchy**
- **Most urgent stuff at top** (today's tasks)
- **Everything else grouped by type** (ideas, shopping, work notes, personal)
- **Search/query at the very top** for when you need something specific

#### **3. Visual Design Principles**

**Simple & Clean:**
- White/light background
- Lots of breathing room
- Clear typography (big enough to read while walking)
- Emoji or simple icons for categories (not too many colors)

**Touch-Friendly:**
- Buttons minimum 44x44px (Apple's guideline)
- Main mic button should be 80-100px
- Swipe gestures: swipe right on a task = complete, swipe left = delete
- No tiny tap targets

**Feedback is Instant:**
- When recording: visual pulsing animation
- When processing: subtle loading indicator
- When saved: quick checkmark animation
- No waiting around wondering if it worked

## The Smart Parts (Where AI Comes In)

### 1. Understanding Context
You say: *"Christopher wants that analysis by EOD"*

**Dumb app would save:** "Christopher wants that analysis by EOD"

**Your app understands:**
- Entity: Christopher (probably a client based on context)
- Task: Analysis (what kind? It might remember if you mentioned it before)
- Due: EOD (today, 5pm or end of business)
- Creates a task automatically

### 2. Connecting the Dots
Later you say: *"Got the data for Christopher's project"*

The app could:
- Link this note to the earlier Christopher task
- Update the task status to "in progress"
- Show them together when you search "Christopher"

### 3. Natural Queries
You ask: *"What's on my plate tomorrow?"*

The app:
- Searches all notes with tomorrow's date
- Prioritizes tasks over casual notes
- Responds conversationally: "You have 2 things: Call Mom at 3pm, and pick up avocados"

## Database Design (Keep It Simple)

### Option 1: Two Tables Approach (Recommended)

**Table 1: `raw_entries`** (Everything you said)
```
id | timestamp | text | audio_url | processed
---------------------------------------------------
1  | 2026-...  | "Call Mom..." | null | true
2  | 2026-...  | "Christopher..." | null | true
```

**Table 2: `structured_items`** (What the AI understood)
```
id | entry_id | type | title | due_date | entities | status
------------------------------------------------------------------
1  | 1        | task | "Call Mom" | 2026-01-13 15:00 | ["Mom"] | pending
2  | 2        | task | "Client analysis" | 2026-01-12 17:00 | ["Christopher"] | pending
```

**Why two tables?**
- Keeps the raw voice input forever (you might need it later)
- Structured table is fast to query and display
- Can re-process old entries if you improve the AI

### Option 2: Single Table with JSON (Simpler for MVP)
```
id | timestamp | raw_text | structured_data (JSON) | processed
----------------------------------------------------------------
1  | 2026-...  | "Call Mom..." | {type: "task", ...} | true
```

## Technical Stack (Keeping It Real)

### Frontend
- **React** (you know it)
- **Vite** (fast, simple)
- **Tailwind CSS** (quick styling)
- **react-markdown** (for displaying notes nicely)

### Voice Recording
- **Browser's MediaRecorder API** (built-in, works on mobile Chrome/Safari)
- No native app needed - Progressive Web App (PWA) is enough

### Backend/Database
**Option A: Replit** (easiest)
- Host the whole thing on Replit
- Use Replit DB (key-value store, stores JSON)
- Simple API routes for saving/fetching

**Option B: Supabase** (more powerful)
- PostgreSQL database (real SQL)
- Built-in auth if you want accounts later
- Free tier is generous
- Host frontend anywhere (Vercel, Netlify)

**Don't use Google Sheets** - too slow, will feel laggy

### APIs
- **OpenAI Whisper** - speech to text ($0.006/minute, very cheap)
- **OpenAI GPT-4** - understanding and queries (~$0.01-0.03 per request)

## Critical Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Should the app auto-categorize or ask?
**Auto-categorize** (Recommended for MVP)
- Faster, less friction
- You can always manually edit later
- The AI will be right 80-90% of the time

### Decision 2: How long should voice recordings be?
**30-60 seconds max per recording**
- Keeps costs low
- Forces clarity (you speak more concisely)
- Can always record multiple short notes

### Decision 3: Should voice queries speak back?
**Text response first, audio optional**
- Faster (no TTS latency)
- You can read it quickly
- Add voice response later if needed

### Decision 4: When should it sync/save?
**Immediately after transcription**
- No "save" button needed
- Feels magical
- Less chance of losing data

## What Makes This Design Good

1. **One primary action** - The mic button is the whole app
2. **No setup required** - Open and start talking
3. **Smart but not confusing** - It organizes things, but you can still see everything
4. **Mobile-native behaviors** - Swipe to complete, pull to refresh, etc.
5. **Fast** - No waiting for sync, everything happens instantly
6. **Forgiving** - Raw text is always there if AI messes up

Does this mental model make sense? Should we start building the basic voice recording + transcription piece first, or do you want to map out more of the UX flow?
